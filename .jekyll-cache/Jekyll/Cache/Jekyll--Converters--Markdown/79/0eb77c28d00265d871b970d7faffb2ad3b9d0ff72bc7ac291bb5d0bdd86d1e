I"ê<p>This project proposes an innovative process that interlinks new data collection, modelling and policy development. By working with policy makers at the highest levels of government (including the Head of the Department for Transport), this project aims to address questions regarding how, where, and when planned policies should be implemented (if at all), what the impacts on local communities would be, whether public transport can cope, and whether there are better alternatives.</p>
